A combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of $2^n$ inputs
and outputs it. Aka. MUX. Available as ICs in market. The selected input line is
configured using $n$ number select lines (or selector variables).

## Advantages

- Reduction of wires
- Reduction of circuit complexity
- Reduction of cost
- Many circuits can be implemented using MUX
