### Ideal Transformer

- No copper losser in the winding
- No leakage flux
- Reluctance of the core is 0
- No core losses

```math
V_{2_\text{rms}} = \frac{N_2}{N_1} V_{1_\text{rms}}
```

As $i_1$ and $i_2$ are opposing:

```math
\mathfrak{f} = N_1i_1 - N_2i_2 = \mathcal{R}\phi
```

As $f=0$: $ $

```math
I_{2_\text{rms}} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} I_{1_\text{rms}}
```

### Power

```math
p_2(t) = p_1(t)
```
