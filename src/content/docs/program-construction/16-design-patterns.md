A design pattern is a set of formalized best practices which are tested and
verified already. Provides a schema of step-by-step template which helps us to
overcome development and architectural problems.

3 types:

- [Creational](/program-construction/creational-design-patterns)
- [Structural](/program-construction/structural-design-patterns)
- [Behavioral](/program-construction/behavioral-design-patterns)

All design patterns are included here for the sake of completeness.
