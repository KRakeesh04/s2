Revise [S1](https://s1.sahithyan.dev) for
[data structures](https://s1.sahithyan.dev/programming-fundamentals/b-book/data-types/).
Defines how data is stored in the computer.

## Array

A fixed-size linear collection of elements. The elements are placed next to each
other in continuous memory.

## Linked List

A linear collection of elements. The elements are placed in non-continuous
memory and the order is preserved using "links".

### Singly Linked List

Each element stores the pointer to the next element. Last element points to
null.

### Doubly Linked List

Each element stores the pointer to both the previous and the next element. First
element's previous element and last element's next element are null.

## Stack

Works as LIFO.

## Queue

Works as FIFO.
