A statistical experiment is a process designed and conducted to obtain data
under a controlled and uncontrolled background. The outcome depends purely on
chance.

## Experimental data

The data gathered from a statistical experiment.

### Sample Space

Set of elements that represent all possible outcomes of a statistical
experiment. Denoted by $S$. $ $

### Sample Point

An element of the sample space.

### Event

A subset of the sample space.

#### Mutually Exclusive

Two events are said to be mutually exclusive if they have no sample points in
common.

#### Independent

Two events are said to be independent when the occurence of one does not affect
the probability of the occurence of the other.

#### Complement

Complement of the event $A$ (of $S$) is denoted by $\overline{A}$. An event
consisting of all the sample points that are in $S$ and not $A$.

#### Union

Union of two or more events, is the event containing all sample points that
belong to any one of the events.

#### Intersection

Intersection of two or more events, is the event containing all sample points
that belong to all of the events.

### Outcome

2 types.

- Discrete
- Continuous

## Observational data

### Population of interest

A group, a researcher wants to study and draw conclusions or inferences about.

### Variable of interest

A changing quantity that is being measured in an experimental study.

### Census

The process of gathering information about the members of a given population of
interest.

### Cohort

A group of subjects who share a particular event during a particular time
duration.
